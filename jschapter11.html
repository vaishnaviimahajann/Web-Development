    <h1>Call Stack</h1>
    <p>Call Stack is a mechanism that tracks function calls in JavaScript. It keeps track of 
        the execution context of each function call, allowing JavaScript to know which
         function is currently running and what functions are waiting to be executed.</p>
    
         <h2>breakpoints</h2>
         <p>Breakpoints are points in the code where execution can be paused for debugging purposes.</p>
         
         <h1>js is single threded laguange</h1>
         <p>JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning it can only execute one 
            task at a time.</p>
            <p>However, JavaScript can handle asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await, allowing it to perform non-blocking tasks while waiting for certain operations to complete.</p>
         <p>using browser we can executed lines in multi ways</p>

         <h1>Call back hell</h1>
            <p>Callback hell refers to a situation where multiple nested callbacks are used, making the code difficult to read and maintain. It often occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations.</p>
         let's understand this with example
         <h3>heloo Javascript</h3>
         <p></p>


         <h1>Promises</h1>
            <p>Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that may be available now, in the future, or never. Promises can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.</p>
         <p>Promises provide a cleaner and more manageable way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks, helping to avoid callback hell.</p>
