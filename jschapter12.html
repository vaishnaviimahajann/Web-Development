    <h1>Async Function </h1>
    <p>Async functions are a way to write asynchronous code in JavaScript that looks synchronous. They return a Promise and can be used with the await keyword to pause execution until a Promise is resolved.</p>
    <p>async and await keywords are used to write asynchronous code in a more readable and manageable way.</p>
    <p>await is used inside an async function to pause execution until a Promise is resolved.</p>
 
    <h1>API :Application Programming Interface</h1>
    <p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how requests and responses should be structured, enabling developers to interact with external services and data.</p>
    <p>APIs can be used to access data, perform operations, and integrate third-party services into applications. They are essential for building modern web applications and enabling interoperability between different systems.</p>
    <p>Some random api are :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/</li>
        <li>https://api.github.com/</li>
        <li>https://openweathermap.org/api</li>
</ul>
<h1>JSON : Java Script Object Notation</h1>
<p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML.</p>
<p>JSON is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language and uses a simple syntax
 <h3>Accesing Data From JSON</h3>

<ul><li>JSON .parse(dat)</li>
<li>JSON.stringify(obj)</li></ul>

<h1>Testing API Request</h1>
<p>To test API requests, you can use tools like Postman, cURL, or browser developer tools. These tools allow you to send HTTP requests to an API endpoint and view the responses, making it easier to debug and understand how the API works.</p>
<p>When testing API requests, you can specify the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), set headers, and include a request body if needed. The response from the API will typically include a status code, headers, and a response body containing the data or message returned by the API.</p>
